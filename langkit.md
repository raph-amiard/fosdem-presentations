# Langkit: A meta compiler

## High level vision

A collection of DSLs to implement language parsing and analysis front-ends.

Front ends generated by Langkit could be the basis for:

[BULLET POINTS]

## Original use case: Libadalang

[Description of Libadalang]

# The DSL

## DSL Episode 1: Lexing
## DSL Episode 2: Tree
## DSL Episode 3: Parsing
## DSL Episode 4: Scoping
## DSL Episode 5: Semantic analysis
## Crafted for Incremental analysis

# The generated libraries

## Base library: Ada (W00T!)

[mention C API here]

## First citizen Python bindings
## Easy to generate bindings to new languages
## Easy to interface
[explain ecore stuff]

## Tree walking
## Rewriting

# Generic tools shipping with the libraries
## Playground
## Vim plug-ins
## Language server protocol? (not done)

# Demo!
